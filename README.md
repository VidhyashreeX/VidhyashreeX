## About me

I’m someone who genuinely enjoys figuring out **how machines think** and then turning that understanding into things people can actually use.

What started as curiosity around AI slowly became a habit of **building systems** — LLM tools, RAG pipelines, backend APIs, and full-stack apps that bring intelligence closer to users instead of keeping it locked inside notebooks.

I like working where **AI meets engineering**. I care about clean logic, readable code, and shipping things that work.  
Still learning every day, still breaking things, still fixing them — and honestly, that’s the fun part.

Currently open to **entry-level roles** in:
AI / ML · Full Stack · Backend · Software Engineering

## Professional experience (what I actually did)

### Full Stack Engineer — AdxReel (Adtip)  
*Dec 2025 – Jan 2026*

This role pushed me closer to **real production work**.

- Built backend REST APIs that powered core product flows  
- Developed React components used directly by end users  
- Integrated third-party services and handled production bugs (yes, real ones)  
- Helped with Docker-based deployments and release readiness  
- Followed clean Git practices across environments  

This experience taught me how features move from code → staging → production, and why small engineering decisions matter a lot later.

### Machine Learning Engineer (Trainee) — Kshipani Tech Ventures  
*Jun 2025 – Sep 2025 | Remote*

This is where I went deep into **LLMs and applied GenAI**.

- Designed LLM-driven chatbots and automation tools  
- Built RAG pipelines using vector databases to improve response relevance  
- Spent a lot of time refining prompts and testing outputs (low-key underrated skill)  
- Exposed ML capabilities through backend APIs so they could actually be used  
- Worked closely with dev teams to bridge ML ideas with engineering reality  

Big takeaway: models are cool, but **deployable systems are cooler**.

### AI & ML Intern — Konigtronics  
*Oct 2024 – Jan 2025 | On-site*

Worked on ML use cases focused on **industrial automation and predictive maintenance**.

- Handled full ML workflows: data prep, training, evaluation  
- Performed structured EDA to extract insights that mattered  
- Built models aimed at reducing downtime and improving efficiency  
- Automated repetitive analysis tasks to save team effort  

This role helped me understand how ML decisions affect real operations, not just metrics.

---

### Cybersecurity Intern — TechByHeart  
*Oct 2023 – Nov 2023*

- Performed vulnerability analysis using Kali Linux and OWASP  
- Simulated real-world attack scenarios  
- Suggested mitigation strategies to improve application security  

It gave me a solid security mindset that I still carry into development.

### MedImageX — Medical Image Viewer & Annotator
Built because most existing tools felt unnecessarily complex.

- Supports DICOM, PNG, JPEG formats  
- Features zoom, drawing tools, and light/dark mode  
- Built with React, TypeScript, KonvaJS, Tailwind CSS  
- Fast, clean, and beginner-friendly
