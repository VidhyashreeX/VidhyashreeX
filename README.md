# Hi, I’m Vidhyashree Shanmugam

AI & Machine Learning Engineer | Full Stack Developer  

## About me

I’m someone who genuinely enjoys figuring out **how machines think** and then turning that understanding into things people can actually use.

What started as curiosity around AI slowly became a habit of **building systems** — LLM tools, RAG pipelines, backend APIs, and full-stack apps that bring intelligence closer to users instead of keeping it locked inside notebooks.

I like working where **AI meets engineering**. I care about clean logic, readable code, and shipping things that work.  
Still learning every day, still breaking things, still fixing them — and honestly, that’s the fun part.

Currently open to **entry-level roles** in:
AI / ML · Full Stack · Backend · Software Engineering

## Education

**B.N.M. Institute of Technology, Bengaluru**  
Bachelor of Engineering — Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
**Oceanik pre-university college**
PCMC
**Parikrma Centre of Learning**
